## Introduction

This is the code repository for the ShinyLearner software. It is a software framework for executing machine-learning classification in a flexible and tidy manner. It integrates various existing machine-learning libraries and makes it possible to perform robust comparisons across algorithms implemented in different machine-learning libraries. In addition, it provides a Web interface to make it easier for non-computational scientists to analyze their own data. More details to come...

Prototype version of Web app (work in progress): [http://shinylearner.byu.edu](http://shinylearner.byu.edu).
