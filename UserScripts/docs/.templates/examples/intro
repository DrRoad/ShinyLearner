The following example illustrates how to execute ShinyLearner using [Docker](https://www.docker.com) on a Unix-based system (e.g., Linux or Mac OS). For additional help or to learn about executing the software on Windows, go [here](http://bioapps.byu.edu/shinylearner/).

The first `-v` argument specifies the directory where the input data files are stored on your computer. In the example below, the data files would be stored in the current working directory (`$(pwd)`). (Within the Docker container, ShinyLearner will access these files via `/InputData`.) If your data files were stored in a location other than the current working directory, you would use something like this: `-v /some/other/directory:/InputData`. It must be an *absolute* path (the `~` shortcut is not supported).

The second `-v` argument specifies the directory where the output files will be stored after ShinyLearner performs the analysis. In the example below, the output files would be stored in a directory called `Output` that is a subdirectory of the current working directory (`$(pwd)`). (Within the Docker container, ShinyLearner will access these files via `/OutputData`.) If you wanted the output files to be placed somewhere else, you would use something like this: `-v /some/other/directory:/OutputData`. It must be an *absolute* path (the `~` shortcut is not supported).

The fourth line in the example below tells Docker to run under the current user's account.

The fifth line in the example below indicates the name and version of the Docker image to be used.

    docker run --rm -i \
      -v "$(pwd)"/:"/InputData" \
      -v "$(pwd)/Output":"/OutputData" \
      --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
      srp33/shinylearner:version{version} \
