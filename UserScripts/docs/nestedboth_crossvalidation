DESCRIPTION

    This command will execute each specified algorithm using a k-fold cross-validation strategy. It will perform classification and feature selection. It will use nested cross validation for algorithm selection and to select features and to optimize the number of selected features. It will output the predictive performance and selected features for each algorithm for the inner (nested) folds and will use a select-best method to make predictions for the outer folds.

REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

    --data [file_path]
    --description [description]
    --iterations [number]
    --outer-folds [number]
    --inner-folds [number]
    --classif-algo [file_path]
    --fs-algo [file_path]
    --num-features [file_path]
    --output-dir [dir_path]

OPTIONAL ARGUMENT

    --verbose

NOTES

    The --data argument allows you to specify input data files in one of the supported formats (see https://github.com/srp33/ShinyLearner/blob/master/InputFormats.md).

    The --description value should be a user-friendly description of the analysis that will be performed. This description will be specified in the output files. If the description contains space characters, be sure to surround it in quotations.

    The --classif-algo argument allows you to specify classification algorithm(s) to be used in the analysis. The value should be a relative path to a script specified under AlgorithmScripts (see https://github.com/srp33/ShinyLearner/blob/master/Algorithms.md).

    The --fs-algo argument allows you to specify feature-selection algorithm(s) to be used in the analysis. The value(s) should be a relative path to a script specified under AlgorithmScripts (see https://github.com/srp33/ShinyLearner/blob/master/Algorithms.md).

    The --data, --classif-algo, and --fs-algo arguments must be used at least once but can be used multiple times. Wildcards may be used (in quotations).

    The --num-features argument should be used once. Multiple values should be separated by commas.

    The --iterations value must be a positive integer. It indicates the number of times that a full round of cross-validation should be performed.

    The --outer-folds and --inner-folds arguments must be integers. If a value is 0 or is identical to the number of samples in the data set, leave-one-out cross validation will be used. If the value is larger than the number of samples in the data set, an error will occur. If neither of these situations occurs, k-fold cross validation will be used, and this integer will be the value of k.

    The --output-dir argument allows you to indicate where output files will be stored. If this directory does not already exist, ShinyLearner will create it. For information about the output files that will be created, see https://github.com/srp33/ShinyLearner/blob/master/OutputFiles.md.

    If the --verbose flag is specified, detailed information about the processing steps will be printed to standard out. This flag is typically used for debugging purposes.
